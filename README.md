# TimeSeries Analysis in Python
### Collection of few Time Series Solutions and their Comparisons

Time Series is a collection of observations collected at certain interval of time. These are analyzed to determine short term and long term trends which leads to forecast the future. 

Time Series is different from other statistical problems like a regular regression or a classification. Why?

1. **Time dependency**: Unlike a linear regression model that the observations are independent, Time Series data fully depends on the past information (previous records).

2. **Seasonality**: Variations specific to a particular time period and/or repetitions of the same fluctuations in the time cycles are treated as Seasonality. For example, if you see the sales of slippers over time, you will invariably find higher sales in summer seasons.

Because of the inherent properties of a Time Series, there are various steps involved in analyzing it. We are not going deep into those steps as there are several documents and project samples made available by many prominent Data Scientists for reference. 

It is obvious that who ever I discuss the various methods that are followed in Time Series, it always ends with a comparison of methods and approaches and it ends no where. Frankly, it cannot end anywhere because of the difference in the characterestics of data like voluima, quality, frequency, etc.  

Please note that the aim of this article is to present what I have found and measured using different techniques and methods used in Time Series models. 

Here for illustrating different methods, I have used different sets of data. Though they are just for the purpose of illustarations, I hope it would somehow make the reader's life easier to pick some what a similar approach when he/she finds a resemblance with the  data at ahand.
